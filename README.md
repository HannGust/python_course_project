This is the GitHub repository for my programming project in the course Advanced Scientific Programming in Python.

Project Description Summary
The idea for my project is to restructure, clean and document the python package I am developing in my PhD. Due to my limited formal programming experience, the project has grown a bit unstructured and cluttered, and therefore unneccessarily difficult to manage, maintain and develop. I would like to revamp it by applying the best-practices taught in this course to it.

Project Outline
Restructuring
- Make the code more modular by gathering "free" code into functions, and collecting the functions into suitable modules, and make sure I am reusing code
- Arrange the code into suitable packages/subpackages

Cleaning
- Removing old, redundant code
- Choosing and enforcing a coding style

Documenting
- Adding more proper documentation to functions, modules and classes
